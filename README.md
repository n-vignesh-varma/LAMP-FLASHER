Dark Activated Led or Lamp Flasher

Description:

This circuit adopts the rather unusual Bowes/White emitter coupled multivibrator circuit. The oscillation frequency is about 1Hz and is set by C1 value. The LED starts flashing when the photo resistor is scarcely illuminated. The onset of flashing can be set by trimming R2.
